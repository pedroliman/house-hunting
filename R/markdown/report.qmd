## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)

```


# Data Cleaning and wrangling:

```{r}
data <- data %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-(select_if()))
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(sold_date = lubridate::as_date(sold_date))
```


```{r}

```


# Some regressions

```{r}

data_model <- data %>%
  mutate(year_built = factor(year_built)) %>%
  mutate(beds = factor(beds))

m <- lm(formula = price ~ beds, data = data_model)

summary(m)

plot_coefs(m)

```
